# **Our Observations**
 ![20.10_1](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/VenA/VA260RN_0431.tif&RGN=0.1831,0.09419,0.6280,0.05740&WID=800&CVT=JPEG)
 - We noticed that Demetrius of Skepsis was cited as a source for an alternate version of the Judgement of Paris.
 - Demetrius of Skepsis is an obscure source. More on that later.


---
# **Our Question**
- Is Demetrius of Skepsis specifically cited in contested stories?
 - We were specifically interested in the _παρα_ + `<persName>` phrase
- We needed to get data on the scholia Demetrius is mentioned in.
 - This should be easy.

---
# **Collecting our Data Set Part 1**
1. Load the scholia data from the `scholia-xml.cex` file


---
# **Collecting our Data Set Part 2**
1. Get every mention of a person in the scholia _(>6600 matches)_
2. Find the preceding word of each person

---
# **Collecting our Data Set Part 3**
1. Filter the preceding words for the following criteria:
 1. _π_ as a first and _ρ_ as a third character. **NOT** _ε_ as a second character
 2. Length of the word over 2 characters and less than 5 characters

_(>140 matches)_

 ---
 # **Collecting our Data Set Part 4**
1. Now we have a list of words where it almost matches _παρα_ we go back to
the following person word
2. Filter them for Demetrius of Skepsis

---
# **Setback Nr. 1**
### There are **no** matches for _παρα_ + Demetrius.###
But: Fail forward.

---
# **Collecting our Data Set Part 5 (resumed)**
1. Find all instances of Demetrius without a restriction on the preceding word
_(11 matches)_
2. Narrow it down to unique scholia _(6 matches)_

---
# **Collecting our Data Set Part 6**
1. With the scholion CtsUrn we could get the contents of the scholion to
analyse the contents.
2. We pulled the 6 scholia from the Corpus

---
# **Setback Nr. 2**
### Is _Areithoos_ the same person as Demetrius of Scepsis?
According to the data he is. Demetrius of Scepsis even occurs in the Iliad!!
_(7.8)_
